# FujiIdol Theme

![](assets/banner.png)

A color palette made from a VTuber and artist that just so happen to be doing a STEM degree. 
Wanting to learn about open-source development whilst expressing my artistic self.

Inspired by [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) and [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) with a bit of VTuber Idol flair to it. 

## Design and Inspiration

The colors are heavily based on some of my favorite artwork that I have made, and given my experience with colors, 
I feel like I have the ability to make some decent color themes with this. 

### NekomiNight

Inspired by a combination of an idol on stage during the day and pool parties during the night, 
it gives a dark color scheme with a visible amount of contrast with an emphasis on colors between the blue to purple range.
